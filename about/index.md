title: About Me
---
Luoyuan Alex Xiong is an undergraduate student studying _Electrical and Electronic Engineering_ at NTU Singapore. I work on applied cryptography, blockchain and computer security.

I enjoy thinking about the irrationalities in our conventional reasoning and maybe thence my craving and appreciation for contrarian disposition. In short, discovering things overlooked or misjudged interests me deeply, especially when I'm the one who took the wrong answer as "truth" for too long.

I'm constantly fascinated by elegant cryptographic constructions.{% marginfigure  'fullwidth' 'assets/img/ring_sig.jpg' '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_signature">Ring Signature</a> based on Schnorr Signature was introduced to me during <a href="http://www.initc3.org/events/2017-07-13-IC3-Ethereum-Crypto-Boot-Camp-at-Cornell-University.html">IC3 BootCamp 2017</a> at <a>Cornell University</a>. <br> It is the first time I find math truly beautiful.'%} Currently devouring _A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography_ {% sidenote 1 '[Boneh,D., Shoup,V.]' %} and _Complexity of Lattice Problem_ {% sidenote 2 '[Micciancio,D., Goldwasser,S.]' %}.

The most fulfilling part about computer security for me is knowing how things work more foundemantally + telling people they are wrong when they claim their system is "secure".

I wish to contribute to a world where technologies are more __open-sourced__, power and decision making are more __decentralized__, __self-motivated__ learning outside the “rewarding system” is more genuinely valued.
