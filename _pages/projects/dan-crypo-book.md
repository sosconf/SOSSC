## 15-second Pitch
This is a collection of my _digisted notes_, some _code snippets_ and discussion on _solutions to selected exercises_ (sometimes further exploration originated but beyond those topics) at the end of each chapter in [A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/cryptobook/BonehShoup_0_4.pdf) by Dan Boneh and Victor Shoup.

## What
What these series of posts **are NOT**:
- They are not a summary, or book excerpts, or a lightweighted replacement for quick skim-read.
- They are not a reference solution to all exercises. (just my attempted answer to selected few)

What these posts **are**:
- a "checklist" for review _after_ you had already gone through certain chapter.
- a personal digest on some subtle details, intricate proof logic, and possibly their implications on real-world applications.
- some code samples (sometimes from standard library, sometimes a naive implementation of attacks).

## IAQ (Infrequently Asked Questions)
### Why did I stop providing all attempted solutions?
As some may or may not notice, only [Chapter 2: Encryption](https://alexxiong.xyz//blog/boneh-crypto-book-chapter2/) post had all the attempted answers, while the rest only "cherry-picked" on a few. The (non-alternative) fact is that I started out planning to upload all my attempted solutions, in the hope that it will serve as a (non-official) reference for future readers, but decided otherwise after finishing the first post. Before I was given a guilty verdict, here are the rationales for such gear-shifting:
1. There had already been an official solution reference.{%sidenote "1" "Please directly approach the authors for the solutions, the existence of such reference was not known to me until an email exchange with Prof. Boneh after I finished the first 3 chapters."%}
2. There are schools that may take some of those questions in their tests/exams.
3. I'd figure: better provide content that provides with some extra value added. (e.g. code sample for letter frequency attack, check list for key concepts for future review, personal digests on tricky or intricate logic to minimize head-scratching for readers.)

With that said, I hunger for discussions on any of those exerices with you. Please tell me your thoughts [via an email](mailto:alex.xiong.tech@gmail.com), of course, any suggestion is more than welcomed!
