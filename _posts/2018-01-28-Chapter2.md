[__TL;DR__]()

 This post contains solutions to Exercises in Chapter 2{% sidenote 1 "A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography [Boneh,D.,Shoup,V.]" %}, which primarily discuss basic concept/building blocks for cryptography study(e.g. Shannon cipher, Definition of Semantic Security, Attack game etc.). On top of that, we dive deeper on further implications and real-life applications motivated from these questions.

## 2.1 (multiplicative one-time pad)
### *Question*:
