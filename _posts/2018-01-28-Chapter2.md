[__TL;DR__]()

 This post contains solutions to Exercises in Chapter 2{% sidenote 1 "A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography [Boneh,D.,Shoup,V.]" %}, which primarily discuss basic concept/building blocks for cryptography study(e.g. Shannon cipher, Definition of Semantic Security, Attack game etc.). On top of that, we dive deeper on further implications and real-life applications motivated by these questions.

## 2.1 (multiplicative one-time pad)
### *Question*: 
{% maincolumn "assets/img/Q2.1.png" %}

### _Solution_:

To prove *correctness*, it's trivial to notice: {% m %} D(k,\; E(k,m)) = k^{-1}\cdot k \cdot m\; mod\; p = m \; mod \; p{% em %}.

To prove *perfect secrecy*, we need to use [Theorem 2.1](#theorem-21), intuitively, what we want to prove is: for a uniformly distributed and randomly selected {%m%}k \in \mathcal K{%em%}, and the probability across all possible ciphertext output is uniform.{% sidenote 2 'The "encryption" is a fair dad, giving each kid the same chance to show up, never playing favorites.' %} More formally, we try to show: For {% m %}k \xleftarrow[]{\text{R}} \mathcal K,\;  m_{0},m_{1}\in\mathcal M,\; c\in\mathcal C{% em %} 
{% math %}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1}
	Pr[\,E(k, m_{0})=c\,]\:=\:Pr[\,E(k,m_{1})=c\,]
\end{equation}
{% endmath %}
Equation \eqref{eq:1} is equivalent to:
