summary: "Attempted solutions of exercises in <u>Chapter 3</u>: primarily on PRG, compositions of PRG, Hybrid Game, PRG predictability, definition of computational indistinguishability based on statistical distance and some common stream ciphers like RC4, ChaCha20, LFSR, Salsa etc."

## Abstract
 This post contains solutions to Exercises in Chapter 3{% sidenote 1 "A Graduate Course in Applied Cryptography [Boneh,D.,Shoup,V.]" %}, which primarily discuss around definition of security of PRG, sequential and parallel compositions of PRG, super important analysis paradigm: Hybrid Game, the definition of PRG predictability, statistical distance and computational indistinguishability {%sidenote 2 "My personal favorite of this chapter is the attack on Linear Congruence Generator (LCG) using closest vector problem in lattice. For me, it's the perfect embodiment of the human creativity and beauty of crypto, make sure you read the case study."%}.
