## TL;DR

This post starts from answering "why do we need Chosen Plaintext Attack threat model?" by reiterating some scenarios provided in the textbook. Then follows my notes on its relationship with the notion of semantic security. Thirdly, crucial concepts for future revisions are then listed out with original definition plus my interpretation or notes. Fourthly, I summarize and visualized a recurring pattern in CPA security proof for generic hybrid construction, which should provide more intuition. Final section provides some extra lessons learned from exercises.
